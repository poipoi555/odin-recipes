            <h2>Description</h2>
        </p>
        <p>
            Tartufo is an Italian dessert of gelato. 
            Originating in the municipality of Pizzo, Calabria, it takes the form of a ball that is composed of two or more flavors of gelato, often with melted chocolate inserted into the center.
            Alternatively, frozen fruits are used. 
            The dessert is typically covered in a shell made of chocolate or cocoa, but sometimes cinnamon or nuts are used.

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 quart vanilla ice cream</li>
            <li>8 maraschino cherries</li>
            <li>2 cups semisweet chocolate chips</li>
            <li>5 tablespoons unrefined coconut oil</li>
            <li>36 chocolate wafer cookies (optional)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup salted roasted pistachios (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Let ice cream stand at room temperature until slightly softened, about 10 minutes. Line 8 small bowls with plastic wrap, leaving a 3-inch overhang.</li>
            <li>Using a 2 oz. (1/4-cup) ice-cream scoop, place 1 scoop of ice cream into the bottom of each bowl.</li>
            <li>Gently press a maraschino cherry into the top of each ice-cream scoop, then top each with another 2 oz. (1/4-cup) scoop of ice cream.</li>
            <li>Working with 1 bowl of ice cream at a time, gather overhanging plastic, wrap it up around ice cream, and gently twist it to form a ball.</li>
            <li>Freeze until ice cream is firm and set, about 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Place chocolate chips in a large microwave-safe bowl, and microwave on HIGH in  (30-second) intervals, stirring thoroughly between intervals, until melted, 3 to 4 minutes total.</li>
            <li>Whisk in coconut oil until the oil is completely melted and combined with the chocolate. Let cool slightly at room temperature, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, pulse cookies and pistachios, if using, in a food processor until finely ground, about 15 quick pulses. Transfer to a shallow bowl, and set aside at room temperature.</li>
            <li>Remove an ice-cream ball from freezer. Remove plastic wrap, and place ice-cream ball on a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet. Pour chocolate mixture over ice-cream ball, allowing it to thinly coat the top and sides.</li>
            <li>Transfer coated ice cream ball to a clean wire rack set inside a large, rimmed baking sheet in the freezer. Repeat process with remaining 7 ice-cream balls.</li>
            <li>Freeze for about 1 hour and serve whenever ready!</li>
        </ol>
